		<p>Well, now that you asked, I work on the front-end; rapid prototyping using nodeJS 
			and angularJS and make all sorts of cool responsive applications for web, 
			tablet and mobile with the help of my awesome team 320NY. We work at the most 
			badass coworking space on the planet called @AlleyNYC.</p>
